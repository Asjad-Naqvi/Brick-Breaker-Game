# Brick-Breaker-Game
This Brick Breaker Game is to show my Object Oriented Programming Skills
Every class has a seprate header and cpp file and there is the main file where each function is called 
Fun part only one object is used in the main function
To play u need to install glut libraries
Then type "make" to compile and "main" to play 
use You're mouse to move the slider
Only one level Because I got lazy :)
